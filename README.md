##  Overview

Mucky is a covert payload delivery open-source project focused on enabling remote access and control through a Pro Micro reverse shell implementation. By utilizing keyboard emulation, Mucky facilitates undetected execution, offering users a discreet method to access and control remote systems.

---

##  Features

|    |   Feature         | Description |
|----|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚öôÔ∏è  | **Architecture**  | Microcontroller-based project utilizing Pro Micro for implementing a reverse shell. Involves keyboard emulation for covert payload delivery. |
| üî© | **Code Quality**  | Codebase demonstrates clear logic and structure, with adherence to best practices. Comments and naming conventions are well-maintained. |
| üìÑ | **Documentation** | Limited documentation available. README provides basic setup instructions but lacks detailed explanations or usage examples. |
| üîå | **Integrations**  | Relies on 'ino' for managing Arduino projects, facilitating easy compilation and deployment. No other significant integrations noted. |
| üß© | **Modularity**    | Codebase lacks significant modularity due to the nature of a specific functionality-focused project. Reusability is limited. |
| üß™ | **Testing**       | No explicit testing frameworks mentioned. Testing likely relies on manual verification and hardware interactions. |
| ‚ö°Ô∏è  | **Performance**   | Performance is dependent on the microcontroller's capabilities. Efficiency is key in executing remote shell functions without detection. |
| üõ°Ô∏è | **Security**      | Limited focus on security measures beyond the core functionality of the reverse shell. Potential for vulnerabilities due to the nature of remote access. |
| üì¶ | **Dependencies**  | Relies on 'ino' for managing Arduino projects. Minimal external dependencies beyond the Arduino ecosystem. |
| üöÄ | **Scalability**   | Limited scalability potential due to the project's specific use case. Scalability involves replicating hardware setups for increased reach. |
